# Java Design Patterns

A comprehensive project demonstrating the implementation of key **Design Patterns** and **SOLID principles** in Java. This project serves as a practical guide for understanding and applying software design principles to build clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

---

## 📚 **Project Overview**
This project is organized into two main parts:
1. **SOLID Principles**: Demonstrates the five core principles of object-oriented programming.
2. **Design Patterns**: Implements key patterns grouped into **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** categories.

Each pattern and principle includes:
- **Detailed code examples**
- **Executable demos**
- **Real-world use cases**

---

## 🚀 **How to Run**
### **Prerequisites**
- Java 8 or later
- Maven or an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Katya1803/java-design-patterns.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd java-design-patterns
3. Build and run the project:
   mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.main.DesignPracticeDemo"
4. Alternatively, run the DesignPracticeDemo class directly from your IDE.


## 🛠️ **Implemented Patterns and Principles**

### SOLID Principles
- S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

  
### Design Patterns
1. **Creational Patterns**
- Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- Factory: Encapsulates object creation.
- Prototype: Creates new objects by cloning existing ones.
2. **Structural Patterns**
- Adapter: Converts one interface into another.
- Decorator: Adds functionality to objects dynamically.
- Proxy: Provides a placeholder for another object.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**
- Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency.
- Strategy: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.
- Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm.

## 🌟 **Highlights**
1. Modular Design: Each pattern and principle is implemented in its own package for clarity and reusability.
2. Executable Framework: Easily run and test each pattern or principle using a centralized manager.
3. Real-World Use Cases: Illustrates practical applications of patterns and principles.
